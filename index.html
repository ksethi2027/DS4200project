    <h1>Air Quality in India: Analyzing Trends, Pollution Causes, and Health Impacts</h1>

    <h2>Introduction:</h2>
    <p>Air pollution is a big environmental and health problem in India, with cities frequently experiencing hazardous air 
        quality due to industrial emissions, traffic, and urbanization. These poor conditions often lead to respiratory and 
        cardiovascular diseases. The Air Quality Index (AQI) provides a comprehensive measure of pollution levels, categorizing 
        air quality from “Good” to “Severe” based on factors like PM2.5, PM10, NO2, and SO2. Understanding these trends is crucial 
        for raising awareness and helping fix the problem. </p>
        
    <p>This project aims to analyze air quality trends in India from January 2020 to December 2024, using historical data to 
        identify pollution patterns. By exploring major pollution sources through data visualization, we aim to provide meaningful 
        insights that can support data-driven solutions for cleaner air and healthier communities.</p>

    <h2>Introduction to the Data:</h2>
    <p>The dataset we selected, from Kaggle.com, provides comprehensive air quality data for major cities across India, covering the period from 2015 to 2024.
        It includes key air pollution indicators such as the Air Quality Index (AQI) and the concentration levels of harmful pollutants.
        The dataset is sourced from publicly available air quality monitoring stations across multiple cities in India. 
        The dataset tracks air quality across 25 major Indian cities, including Delhi, Mumbai, Kolkata, Chennai, Bengaluru, Hyderabad, etc.
        We hope to gain more insights on what cities are at higher health risks and potential causes of the pollutants.

        This map visually represents air quality conditions across different cities. Cities like Chennai and Bangalore frequently experience 
        "Very Poor" or "Severe" air quality, whereas coastal cities like Mumbai and Kolkata tend to have better air quality.
    </p>
    <p class="map-description">
        By mapping this data, we can observe how factors like climate, traffic, and population impact long-term pollution trends. The colored 
        stars correspond to different AQI categories, as shown in the legend, allowing for quick comparisons across India.
