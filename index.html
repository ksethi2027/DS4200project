    <h1>Air Quality in India: Analyzing Trends, Pollution Causes, and Health Impacts</h1>

    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>Air pollution is a serious environmental and health issue in India, with many cities facing hazardous air quality due to industrial emissions, traffic, and urbanization. Poor air quality can lead to respiratory and cardiovascular diseases. The Air Quality Index (AQI) measures pollution levels, categorizing air quality from “Good” to “Severe” based on pollutants like PM2.5, PM10, NO2, and SO2.</p>

    <p>This project analyzes air quality trends in India from January 2020 to December 2024, identifying pollution patterns using historical data. By visualizing major pollution sources, we aim to provide insights that can support data-driven solutions for cleaner air.</p>

    <p>For more information on pollution trends, check out <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/19/world/asia/india-delhi-air-pollution.html">The New York Times</a> & <a href="https://www.iqair.com/us/india">IQAir</a>.</p>

    <h2>Introduction to the Data</h2>
    <p>The dataset, sourced from Kaggle, tracks air quality data from 2015 to 2024 across 25 major Indian cities, including Delhi, Mumbai, Kolkata, Chennai, Bengaluru, and Hyderabad. It includes key pollution indicators such as AQI and concentrations of harmful pollutants.</p>

    <h2>Map of India and AQI Bucket Levels</h2>
    <p>This map highlights the most common AQI bucket levels in major Indian cities over the past five years.</p>

        </div>
        <div>
            <p>This map visually represents air quality conditions across different cities. Cities like Chennai and Bangalore frequently experience "Very Poor" or "Severe" air quality, whereas coastal cities like Mumbai and Kolkata tend to have better air quality.</p>
            <p>By mapping this data, we can observe how factors like climate, traffic, and population impact long-term pollution trends. The colored stars correspond to different AQI categories, as shown in the legend, allowing for quick comparisons across India.</p>

    <h2>CO Levels in Major Indian Cities</h2>
    <p>This interactive chart displays Carbon Monoxide (CO) levels across different cities in India.</p>

    <h2>Average O3 Levels</h2>
              <div id="barplot"></div>
              <script src="https://d3js.org/d3.v7.min.js"></script>
              <script src="final.js"></script>  
              <p>The bar plot visualizes the average O3 (ozone) levels across five major Indian cities—Kolkata, Delhi, Mumbai, 
                  Bangalore, and Chennai—showing that the values are nearly identical, with only slight variations. This consistency 
                  suggests that ozone pollution is driven by common factors across these cities, such as vehicle emissions, 
                  industrial activity, and climate conditions that contribute to ozone formation. Since O3 is a key component of 
                  smog and has significant health impacts, understanding these patterns is crucial. </p>
                  
                  <p>The O3 levels appear to be around 
                  100, which is relatively high and could pose health risks. According to air quality standards, prolonged exposure to 
                  ozone levels above this threshold can lead to respiratory issues and other serious health concerns, particularly for 
                  vulnerable populations. This visualization supports our broader analysis of air quality trends in India by identifying
                  cities with elevated ozone concentrations and emphasizing the need for stricter pollution control measures to 
                  mitigate health risks and improve air quality.</p>
